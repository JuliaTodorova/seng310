					        	<p>2 cups salted water</p>
					        	<p>1 cup quinoa</p>
					        	<p>1 bunch lacinato kale, washed and chopped into 1" lengths</p>
					        	<p>1 meyer lemon, zested and juiced</p>
					        	<p>2 scallions, minced</p>
					        	<p>1 tablespoon toasted walnut oil</p>
					        	<p>3 tablespoons toasted pine nuts</p>
					        	<p>1/4	cup crumbled goat cheese</p>
					        	<p>Salt and Pepper</p>
					        </div>
					        <ol>
					        	<li>Bring the water to a boil in a covered pot. Add the quinoa, cover, and lower the heat until it is just enough to maintain a simmer. Let simmer for 10 minutes, then top with the kale and re-cover. Simmer another 5 minutes, then turn off the heat and allow to steam for 5 more minutes.</li>
					        	<li>While the quinoa is cooking, take a large serving bowl and combine half of the lemon juice (reserving the other half), all of the lemon zest, scallions, walnut oil (you can substitute olive oil if you desire), pine nuts, and goat cheese.</li>
					        	<li>Check the quinoa and kale when the cooking time has completed -- the water should have absorbed, and the quinoa will be tender but firm, and the kale tender and bright green. If the quinoa still has a hard white center, you can steam a bit longer (adding more water if needed). When the quinoa and kale are done, fluff the pilaf, and tip it into the waiting bowl with the remaining ingredients. As the hot quinoa hits the scallions and lemon it should smell lovely. Toss to combine, seasoning with salt and pepper, and the remaining lemon juice if needed.</li>

					        </div>
					        <ol>
					        	<li>Preheat oven to 350 degrees. Soak dried mushrooms in 2 cups boiling water.</li>
					        	<li>Season ribs well with salt and pepper. Heat oil in large, heavy pot (I used a 5-qt. enameled cast iron dutch oven) over medium heat until shimmering. Brown ribs in batches for 2-3 minutes per side, then set aside. Pour out all but 1 tablespoon of accumulated fat from pot, then sauté onion, carrots and celery until soft. Add garlic and stir until fragrant.</li>
					        	<li>Create a hot spot in the pot by moving vegetables aside and leaving about a 3-inch radius bare. Add tomato paste and anchovy paste to the hot spot and stir vigorously until caramelized, then stir into the vegetables. Add red wine to deglaze and cook until liquid is reduced by half. Add tomatoes, mustard, Worcestershire sauce, mushrooms and soaking liquid (minus the last 1/4 inch to keep sediment out of your dish), plus herbs.</li>
					        	<li>Add ribs to pot and fill with chicken stock or water until ribs are nearly covered. Bring liquid to a boil, then cover tightly and braise in oven for at least 3 hours or until ribs are fall-apart tender.</li>
					        	<li>Remove ribs from liquid and set aside until cool enough to handle. Remove bay leaves and discard. While ribs cool, purée the braising liquid with an immersion blender until thick and set over medium-low heat to reduce if the sauce seems thin. When ribs have cooled down, discard bones and large pieces of fat, then shred the beef and return it to the pot. Remove from heat and cool to room temperature, skimming any large pools of fat from the surface.</li>
					        	<li>Refrigerate overnight. The next day, remove additional fat from the surface before reheating. Serve over polenta, sprinkled with gremolata.</li>

					        	<li>Preheat oven to 325 F. Pat meat dry. Season all over with salt and pepper.</li>
					        	<li>Heat 2 tablespoons olive oil in large Dutch-oven or oven-proof pan with lid over medium-high heat. Working in batches, add beef to pan in one layer. Brown on all sides. Transfer beef to a bowl.</li>
					        	<li>Add cognac to pan and deglaze pan over medium-high heat, scraping up bits. Allow to reduce by half. Pour cognac over beef.</li>
					        	<li>Coarsely chop 2 carrots. Heat 2 tablespoons olive oil in same pan. Add chopped carrots, onion and garlic. Sauté 3 minutes over medium heat. Add beef with cognac, wine, stock, tomato paste and thyme. (Beef should be covered by the wine and stock. If not, add more wine or stock to cover.)</li>
					        	<li>Bring to a boil, reduce heat to low and cook 2 minutes. Cover and place in oven. Bake until meat is very tender, 2 1/2 -3 hours.</li>
					        	<li>About 30 minutes before beef is done, cut remaining carrots in 1/2" slices. Steam or blanch carrots until crisp tender; drain.</li>
					        	<li>Heat 1 tablespoon olive oil in skillet over medium heat. Sauté pearl onions and mushrooms until light golden brown.</li>
					        	<li>Remove beef from oven. Strain liquid from stew into a saucepan. Separate beef from the cooked vegetables and discard vegetables. Boil liquid until reduced by half and thickened to a sauce consistency, skimming fat from surface. Add sugar. Season to taste with salt and pepper.</li>
					        	<li>Add beef, carrots, pearl onions and mushrooms to stock. Simmer 15 minutes to heat through. Serve in warm bowls.</li>
					        	<li>Beef Bourguignon may be prepared up to two days in advance. Cover and refrigerate. Before reheating, discard any solidified fat from surface. Reheat over medium-low heat on stovetop or in a 325 F. oven.</li>

						        <p>Serves 4</p>
					        	<p>2 tablespoons whole green peppercorns, divided</p>
					        	<p>1 teaspoon fine sea salt</p>
					        	<p>1/4 teaspoon ground clove</p>
					        	<p>1/2 teaspoon ground cardamom</p>
					        	<p>1 pound tiniest potatoes you can find </p>
					        	<p>Two 1-pound boneless duck breasts with skin</p>
					        	<p>2 cloves peeled garlic</p>
					        	<p>1 cup homemade chicken stock</p>
					        	<p>1 tablespoon unrefined raw coconut oil</p>
					        	<p>1 jalapeño, slivered</p>
					        	<p>1/2	cup roughly chopped cilantro</p>
					        </div>
					        <ol>
					        	<li>Grind a teaspoon of the green peppercorns and mix with the salt, clove, and cardamom. Rub the duck breasts with this mixture and marinate for about 30 minutes before cooking. Meanwhile, blanch the potatoes in abundant, salted boiling water until just tender. Drain and keep warm.</li>
					        	<li>Score the duck breasts in a cross-hatch pattern and then place skin side down in a single layer and cook, without turning, over very low heat, until the fat has rendered out of the skin and the skin is crispy and golden, about 40 minutes.</li>
					        	<li>When the skin is golden and the fat is rendered, strain and reserve the fat. Turn the pan up to high, flip the duck breast to skin side up, and cook briefly about 3 minutes. Remove the duck breast from the pan and allow to rest 10 minutes.</li>
					        	<li>While the duck is resting, return the pan to the heat with one tablespoon of the reserved duck fat. Toast the garlic and the remaining green peppercorns in the duck fat and when the garlic begins to color and become fragrant, add the chicken stock and cook briskly until reduced by two-thirds.</li>
					        	<li>Toss the warm potatoes with the coconut oil, the jalapeño, and the chopped cilantro. Season lightly with salt. Serve the duck breast sliced, with the potatoes and the green peppercorn sauce.</li>
